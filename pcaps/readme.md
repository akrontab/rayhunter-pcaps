Besure to drop your pcaps here in thier own directory. Also include a readme.md file giving context to the pcap. Include as much or as little information in the readme.md as you like, but approximate location and date time of where and when the pcap was taken is most welcome!

As always be mindful of your opsec, and your threat model. Be safe out there and YMMV!
